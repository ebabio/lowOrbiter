# orbiterHillProblem
Analysis of a low altitude orbiter about a satellite under the effect of tidal perturbations from a planet. 
Considered perturbations are the tidal force form the planet and the oblateness of the satellite.
The mean orbital element analysis reduces to the mean motion of the eccentricity vector. This motion becomes unstable for high inclination orbits.

Includes:
1. Report describing the theoretical analysis and comparison with fully numerical methods.
1. Mathematica script for analytical derivations.
1. MATLAB library for full numerical integration of the problem.
1. MATLAB script for analysis of the phase plane of the problem.
