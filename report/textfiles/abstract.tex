	We consider the motion of an orbiter about a central body which is orbiting a much more massive third body that effects a tidal perturbation on the orbiter. The effect of the tidal perturbation is shown to lead to instability in the eccentricity for high inclination orbits which would lead to impact against the central body with no control of the vehicle. This work derives a first order analytical theory for the motion of the satellite and determines stability conditions. These conditions are then compared against numerical especial perturbation methods.
